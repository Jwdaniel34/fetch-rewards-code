Hello Everyone,

I hope all is well, I have a few updates and questions 
about the data received. We were able to effectively analyze the data
and show visualizations, please see our github to view.

1) As far as the data, will we be tracking the receipt ids per 
receipt item? 

2) We may have a few columns that are centered around  rewards and if we are tracking
for rewards would we consider a dataset tracking rewards?

3) If an item does not show the name or description, will there 
be a way to cross reference through a different source?

After continued analysis the data quality seems to have a few issues. 
The data is compacted into the receipt dataset which may cause unnesscary duplicated item receipt_id.
If we would like to resolve this issue we would have to create a dataset that has the information 
mainly for the item and the receipt_id to connect to our users.

I do see some time performance issues if we are rolling through each dataset. Due to the duplications on the items
receiving a receipt_id. It could take some time to run smoothly. If we anticipate using any visualizations
on the cloud this may slow us down visually. I can plan on removing any data that is not described but this may take away
from possible predictions and analysis we can make. 

Please let me know if this information helps direct where we should go further. I would be happy to assist.

Best Regards,
John Daniel,
